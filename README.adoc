= DDD in Action: Strategies and Tactics for Java Solutions
:toc: auto

This repository contains the **labs** used in the https://github.com/o-s-expert/ddd-workshop[DDD in Action Workshop].
Each lab demonstrates how to apply **strategic and tactical DDD** patterns in Java, with persistence support using **MongoDB** and **Oracle NoSQL**.

== Requirements

* Java 21 or higher
* Git
* Maven
* An IDE of your choice (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)
* Docker
* Docker Compose

== Project Structure

All labs are organized inside a **single Maven project**, and each one builds upon the previous step.
Follow them in order to get the best learning experience.

== Database Setup

The labs require both **MongoDB** and **Oracle NoSQL**.
A `docker-compose.yml` file is included at the root of the project to start them easily:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

This will start:
* MongoDB on port `27017`
* Oracle NoSQL on its configured port (default `8080` for admin, `5000` for client driver)

== Running the Labs

Build the project:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

Run a specific lab (replace `labX` with the module name):

[source,bash]
----
mvn exec:java -pl labX
----

== How to Use

1. Start the databases with Docker Compose.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Build with Maven.
4. Navigate to the desired lab module.
5. Run it following the provided examples.

== Notes

* Ensure Docker is running before starting.
* Data from MongoDB and Oracle NoSQL will persist in Docker volumes.
* To reset everything, run:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose down -v
----
